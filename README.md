**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** The Udacity Reviews API has been shut down. `urcli` no longer works and this repo has been archived. Thanks to everyone who contributed with code and ideas!

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v6.0.0 or higher
- NPM (v3.0.0+ recommended) (this comes with Node.js)

## :zap: Quickstart

1. Run `npm install -g urcli`.
2. Get a new token from the API Access link in the [Reviewer Dashboard](https://review.udacity.com/#!/submissions/dashboard). <img src="http://i.imgur.com/QH7onbk.png" alt="Token retrieval" width="500px">
3. Run `urcli setup`. When prompted, paste in the token you just got and then go through the rest of the setup.
4. Run `urcli assign` proceeded by valid project ids for projects you are certified for. Ex:
    - `urcli assign 145`, places you in the queue for project 145.
    - `urcli assign 134 145 46`, places you in the queues for project 145, 134 and 46.
    - `urcli assign all`, places you in the queue for every project you are certified for.
5. Profit! (literally).

## Upgrade

2. Get a new token (See Quickstart #2).
1. Press `ESC` to stop the currently running instance (If you have urcli running).
3. Run `npm i -g urcli`.
4. Run `urcli setup`.
5. Run your assign command, `urcli assign all`.
